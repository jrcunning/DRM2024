    - [ ] Variability in bleaching among individuals within a species (where do tol. and sens. individuals cooccur?) which spp have the most variability among individuals?
    - [ ] Where are heat-tolerant individuals? i.e., most non-bleached individuals rel. to DHW
    - [ ] Are juveniles doing better (less bleaching) than larger adult colonies for any species?
